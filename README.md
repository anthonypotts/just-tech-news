# Just-Tech-News

## Description
Just-Tech-News is a website that allows users to post articles regarding new development technologies, upvote their favorites, and leave comments to stimulate conversation and comradery. This is my first complete full stack project. This first phase I've developed the back end, creating a database and assembling the routes and methods.
